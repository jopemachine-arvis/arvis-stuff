# Outline

This document describe about arvis's detailed implementations.

First, will describe why I'm started making arvis, (1)

Then the reason I chose electron as framework. (2)

And will describe about differences with Alfred, and the reasons. (3)

Then will describe related librarays, how they work together, the reason for cloning some librarays (alfy related). (19, 5)

Then will describe each libraray's how it works, implementation. (4, 7, 8, 9, 10)

And will describe arvis's implementations more specifically.

Here's a summary of arvis's implementations.

Starting with process hierarchy used within arvis (18), how hotkey feature is implemented (11),

about user config (12), redux store synchronization with multiple renderer processes (13),

how workflow feature works (17), how arvis finds search commands, how file watchcer works.

And at last, will describe differences with other launchers in Evaluation.
