# Why did you clone alfy and its other libs related alfy.

1. I thought unifying programming language with js is efficient.

2. Lots of alfred-workflow are written in alfy. This means with alfred-to-arvis (converter), I can convert lots of alfred-workflows to arvis-workflows if there is alfy of arvis.
So, I decided to alfy and alfy workflows. and I named the cloned lib `arvish`.

3. Because I don't want to change alfy API and its behavior, API (on workflow) is basically totally same with alfy. And I thought it is also great to have other libs in arvish that alfy use. So I cloned the libs and modify behaviors to work with arvis. (`arvis-linker`, `arvis-notifier` and others)
