# Why did you choose electron as framework

1. Personal reason is that I'm used to typescript, javascript and I wanted to try to use electron.

2. Electron supports full feature of chromium. This means lots of feature of chromium are available with minimal efforts. I expected this point to increase the number of works I can do.

3. Many alfred-workflow are built with `alfy` (javascript). I've thought I also need to create library help users create their own extension easily. I decided to use clone `alfy` and I thought to unify programming language with js is efficient to work.

4. Electron has lots of awesome librarays. I thought I could do more works with this awesome libs than using other platforms in the same time.
