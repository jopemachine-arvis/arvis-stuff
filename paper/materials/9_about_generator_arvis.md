# About generator-arvis

Extension developer can generate skeleton of arvisworkflow file, arvisplugin file through arvish.

But I think if possible, generating whole project is good.

generator-arvis is built with `yeoman`, well-known web scaffolding tool.

With generator-arvis, extension developer can scaffold out arvis extension project's skeleton files easily.
